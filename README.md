# Aselia

A PSOBB Private Server  

### History
This project started as a rewrite of **Tethealla**, but after writing from scratch the Patch and Login and part of the Ship servers, I figured I needed to go for a different language to expand on features, and improvements that would otherwise take too long to make.  
Given the fact that most of my programming experience has been in C#, it just made sense to use it for this project and this was the start of **Tethealla#**.  
A while after porting the rewritten C code I wanted to give a more 'original' name to the project and a friend suggested **Aselia**, which stays within the trend of PSOBB private server names (**Tethealla** and **Sylverant**), and that's how the current iteration of this project was born.  

### Status
The Login and Ship server, their specific libraries, the client library and the (Ultima's) Launcher are being developed privately.  
They will eventually be hosted in this repository but I don't know when that will happen. In the meantime you can see the [latest changes](https://www.phantasystaronline.net/forum/index.php?/topic/26809-change-log/&do=getNewComment) in [Ultima](https://www.phantasystaronline.net/forum/), the topic includes change logs of basically everything in the server, the posts titled Test Server are the ones about to Aselia.

### Dependencies
This project depends on several other libraries listed below.  
Not all the libraries are required for some of the projects.
