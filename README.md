# Aselia

A PSOBB Private Server  

### History
This project started as a rewrite of **Tethealla**, but after writing from scratch the Patch and Login and part of the Ship servers, I figured I needed to go for a different language to expand on features, and improvements that would otherwise take too long to make.  
Given the fact that most of my programming experience has been in C#, it just made sense to use it for this project and this was the start of **Tethealla#**.  
After a while after porting the rewritten C code I wanted to give a more 'original' name to the project and a friend suggested **Aselia**, which stays within the trend of PSOBB private server names (**Tethealla** and **Sylverant**).
